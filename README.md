## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Browser Console Only**: This script runs in the browser console, not as a Node.js application
- **Website Changes**: The script may need updates if NY Tech Week changes their website structure
- **Rate Limiting**: Be respectful - don't overload their servers with rapid requests
- **Data Accuracy**: Always verify critical event details on the official website before registering

## 🙋‍♂️ FAQ

**Q: Why browser console instead of a proper scraper?**  
A: The NY Tech Week website likely uses dynamic loading. Browser execution ensures all content is fully rendered.

**Q: Can I automate this to run daily?**  
A: You could use tools like Puppeteer or Selenium to automate browser execution, but please be respectful of their servers.

**Q: What if the website structure changes?**  
A: The selectors in `main.js` may need updating. Check the DOM structure and update the CSS selectors accordingly.
